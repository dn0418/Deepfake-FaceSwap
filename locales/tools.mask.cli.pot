"R|Masker to use.\n"
"L|components: Mask designed to provide facial segmentation based on the positioning of landmark locations. A convex hull is constructed around the exterior of the landmarks to create a mask.\n"
"L|extended: Mask designed to provide facial segmentation based on the positioning of landmark locations. A convex hull is constructed around the exterior of the landmarks and the mask is extended upwards onto the forehead.\n"
"L|vgg-clear: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly frontal faces clear of obstructions. Profile faces and obstructions may result in sub-par performance.\n"
"L|vgg-obstructed: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly frontal faces. The mask model has been specifically trained to recognize some facial obstructions (hands and eyeglasses). Profile faces may result in sub-par performance.\n"
"L|unet-dfl: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly frontal faces. The mask model has been trained by community members and will need testing for further description. Profile faces may result in sub-par performance."
