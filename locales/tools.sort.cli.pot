"R|Sort by method. Choose how images are sorted. \n"
"L|'blur': Sort faces by blurriness.\n"
"L|'face': Use VGG Face to sort by face similarity. This uses a pairwise clustering algorithm to check the distances between 512 features on every face in your set and order them appropriately.\n"
"L|'face-cnn': Sort faces by their landmarks. You can adjust the threshold with the '-t' (--ref_threshold) option.\n"
"L|'face-cnn-dissim': Like 'face-cnn' but sorts by dissimilarity.\n"
"L|'face-yaw': Sort faces by Yaw (rotation left to right).\n"
"L|'hist': Sort faces by their color histogram. You can adjust the threshold with the '-t' (--ref_threshold) option.\n"
"L|'hist-dissim': Like 'hist' but sorts by dissimilarity.\n"
"L|'color-gray': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted grayscale color channel.\n"
"L|'color-luma': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Y color channel. Bright lighting and oversaturated images will be ranked first.\n"
"L|'color-green': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Cg color channel. Green images will be ranked first and red images will be last.\n"
"L|'color-orange': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Co color channel. Orange images will be ranked first and blue images will be last.\n"

msgid "Float value. Minimum threshold to use for grouping comparison with 'face-cnn' and 'hist' methods. The lower the value the more discriminating the grouping is. Leaving -1.0 will allow the program set the default value automatically. For face-cnn 7.2 should be enough, with 4 being very discriminating. For hist 0.3 should be enough, with 0.2 being very discriminating. Be careful setting a value that's too low in a directory with many images, as this could result in a lot of directories being created. Defaults: face-cnn 7.2, hist 0.3"

For face-yaw the number of bins is by how much 180 degrees is divided. So if you use 18, then each folder will be a 10 degree increment. Folder 0 will contain faces looking the most to the left whereas the last folder will contain the faces looking the most to the right. If the number of images doesn't divide evenly into the number of bins, the remaining images get put in the last bin. Default value: 5"
