"R|Sort by method. Choose how images are sorted. \n"
"L|'blur': Sort faces by blurriness.\n"
"L|'blur-fft': Sort faces by fft filtered blurriness.\n"
"L|'distance' Sort faces by the estimated distance of the alignments from an "
"'average' face. This can be useful for eliminating misaligned faces.\n"
"L|'face': Use VGG Face to sort by face similarity. This uses a pairwise "
"clustering algorithm to check the distances between 512 features on every "
"face in your set and order them appropriately.\n"
"L|'face-cnn': Sort faces by their landmarks. You can adjust the threshold "
"with the '-t' (--ref_threshold) option.\n"
"L|'face-cnn-dissim': Like 'face-cnn' but sorts by dissimilarity.\n"
"L|'face-yaw': Sort faces by Yaw (rotation left to right).\n"
"L|'hist': Sort faces by their color histogram. You can adjust the threshold "
"with the '-t' (--ref_threshold) option.\n"
"L|'hist-dissim': Like 'hist' but sorts by dissimilarity.\n"
"L|'color-gray': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted "
"grayscale color channel.\n"
"L|'color-luma': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Y "
"color channel. Bright lighting and oversaturated images will be ranked "
"first.\n"
"L|'color-green': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Cg "
"color channel. Green images will be ranked first and red images will be "
"last.\n"
"L|'color-orange': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Co "
"color channel. Orange images will be ranked first and blue images will be "
"last.\n"
"L|'size': Sort images by their size in the original frame. Faces closer to "
"the camera and from higher resolution sources will be sorted first, whilst "
"faces further from the camera and from lower resolution sources will be "
"sorted last.\n"
"L|'black-pixels': Sort images by their number of black pixels. Useful when "
"faces are near borders and a large part of the image is black.\n"
"Default: face"

"Integer value. Number of folders that will be used to group by blur, face-"

"last folder will be the blurriest. For face-yaw the number of bins is by how "
"much 180 degrees is divided. So if you use 18, then each folder will be a 10 "
"degree increment. Folder 0 will contain faces looking the most to the left "
"whereas the last folder will contain the faces looking the most to the "
"right. If the number of images doesn't divide evenly into the number of "
"bins, the remaining images get put in the last bin. For black-pixels it "
"represents the divider of the percentage of black pixels. For 10, first "
"folder will have the faces with 0 to 10%% black pixels, second 11 to 20%%, "
"etc. Default value: 5"
